# Website Blocker 
Sometimes we need something which makes us avoid infinite pool of distractions and work on important tasks. That's where a website blocker comes in handy.

## Steps
- Clone the Code in your local machine
- List the websites you want to block on your machine, Add them in the websites list
- Set the Working Hours in which you wish to focus in the start and end timings
- Keep the hosts path same if you are a windows user but change it to etc/hosts for Linux / Mac Os
- Save the file with .pyw extension and then add a task in Task Scheduler with a trigger at the startup and add the file to the task.
- Tadaa! Now you will not be able to open those websites until you are done with your working hours.
- ✨Magic ✨
